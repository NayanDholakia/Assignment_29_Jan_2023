    "\"\"\"Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "'''The close() function is used to close a file in Python. It's important to close a file after we're done with it because it frees up resources on your computer\n",
    "and ensures that the file's data is saved correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a file is opened, the operating system reserves a specific amount of memory to hold the file's contents and to keep track of where you are in \n",
    "the file (known as the file pointer). This memory is not freed until the file is closed, which means that if you open a large number of files \n",
    "without closing them, your computer could run out of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, when you write to a file, the data is not immediately saved to the file on your hard drive. Instead, it's temporarily stored in a buffer\n",
    "(a small area of memory) and is only saved to the file when the buffer is flushed (that is, when it's full or when the file is closed). \n",
    "If we don't close the file, the data in the buffer may be lost if the program terminates before the buffer is flushed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it's a best practice to always close a file after we're done with it, to avoid running out of memory and to ensure that the file's data is saved \n",
    "correctly. This can be done using the close() method, as shown in the example I provided in my previous answer. Another way to ensure that a file is closed\n",
