    "A database is a structured collection of data organized and stored in a way that enables efficient retrieval, \n",

    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of database management systems \n",

    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: SQL databases are based on a structured model that uses tables with predefined schemas to store data. \n",
    "The schema defines the structure of the tables, including the columns and data types.\n",
    "Data Integrity: SQL databases enforce strong data integrity constraints, ensuring that data follows \n",
    "predefined rules and relationships defined by the schema. This helps maintain data consistency and accuracy.\n",
    "Query Language: SQL databases use the SQL language for querying and manipulating data.\n",
    "SQL provides a standardized way to interact with the database, allowing users to perform \n",
    "complex queries, joins, aggregations, and transactions.\n",
    "Relational Model: SQL databases are based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables with rows and columns. \n",
    "Relationships between tables are established using primary and foreign keys, enabling data normalization \n",
    "and efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases typically excel in handling structured data and complex queries. \n",
    "They are well-suited for applications with complex relationships and transactions.\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: NoSQL databases are designed to store unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "They use various models like key-value, document, columnar, or graph to store and organize data.\n",
    "Flexibility: NoSQL databases offer flexible schemas, allowing for dynamic and schema-less data. \n",
    "Each record in a NoSQL database can have a different structure, and new fields can be \n",
    "added without altering the existing data.\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data and high-velocity workloads. \n",
    "They are designed for distributed environments and can scale horizontally across multiple servers.\n",
    "Performance: NoSQL databases prioritize high performance and scalability over complex querying capabilities. \n",
    "They often provide fast read and write operations by denormalizing data and optimizing for specific access patterns.\n",
    "Querying: NoSQL databases have their own query languages or APIs for data retrieval and manipulation.\n",
    "These languages may have limited querying capabilities compared to SQL but are tailored to the specific database model.\n",
    "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on various factors such as the nature of data, \n",
    "scalability requirements, querying needs, and the specific use case of the application. \n",
    "SQL databases are commonly used for structured data and complex querying,\n",

    "    \n",
    "ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "ADD Department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table, but it keeps the table structure intact. \n",

    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. \n",
    "It serves as a unique identifier for the records in the table and ensures that each row has a distinct identity.\n",
    "Here are some key points about primary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uniqueness: A primary key must have a unique value for each row in the table.\n",
    "No two rows can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Non-nullability: A primary key cannot have a NULL value. It must have a value for every row.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Single Column or Composite Key: A primary key can be a single column or a combination of multiple columns. \n",
    "When multiple columns are used, it is called a composite key.\n",

    "4. Indexing: Primary keys are automatically indexed in most database systems.\n",
    "Indexing enhances the search and retrieval performance for queries that involve the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Integrity: Primary keys ensure data integrity by enforcing entity uniqueness and \n",

    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that refers to the primary key of another table. \n",
    "It establishes a relationship between two tables, known as the parent table and the child table. \n",
    "Here are some key points about foreign keys:\n",

    "1. Relationship: A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables by linking a column(s) \n",
    "in the child table to the primary key of the parent table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Referential Integrity: Foreign keys enforce referential integrity, meaning that the values \n",
    "in the foreign key column(s) must match the values of the primary key column(s) in the referenced table. \n",
    "This ensures the integrity of the relationship between the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cascading Actions: Foreign keys can be configured with cascading actions to maintain data consistency.\n",
    "For example, when a record is deleted or updated in the parent table,\n",
    "the corresponding records in the child table can be automatically deleted, updated, or set to NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Many-to-One Relationship: Foreign keys typically represent a many-to-one relationship between the child table and\n",
    "the parent table. This means that multiple rows in the child table can reference the same row in the parent table.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Indexing: It is common for foreign keys to be indexed to improve performance when joining or \n",
    "searching based on the foreign key.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using primary keys and foreign keys, relational databases establish relationships between tables, \n",

    "Executing a SQL query: The execute() method of the cursor is used to execute a SQL query.\n",

    "You need to provide the SQL query as a string parameter to the execute() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fetching the results: The fetchall() method is called on the cursor object to retrieve all\n",

    "which can be iterated over to process each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing the cursor and connection: Finally, the close() method is called on both the cursor\n",

    "The cursor() and execute() methods are important components of the MySQL Connector/Python API:\n",
    "\n",
    "cursor(): This method creates a cursor object that allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch the results. \n",
    "The cursor object provides methods like execute(), fetchone(), fetchall(), etc., to interact with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "execute(): The execute() method of the cursor is used to execute SQL queries.\n",
    "You pass the SQL query as a string parameter to this method. \n",
    "It can be used for various types of SQL statements like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.\n",
    "After executing the query, you can use other cursor methods like fetchone() or fetchall() to retrieve the results.\n",
